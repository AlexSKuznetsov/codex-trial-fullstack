# Trial task for fullstack developer

In this trial task you are asked to create an application that provides a simple create-and-retrieve interface for a cars inventory. The application is required to be designed as a SPA based on React.JS for frontend and any node.js http server for backend. The application must feature a grid suitable to represent a paged sorted list of cars (total number of cars in the inventory might exceed 1000 items). Besides that, the application must provide a form that allows to add a new car into the inventory.

Please use the data dump provided within the repository to have a reference of the application's domain model.

Your submission must contain the following artifacts besides the application code:

* Two test suites, one for the frontend and one for the backend
* Two Dockerfile descriptors for each part of the application
* docker-compose.yml descriptor that would allow to run both parts of the application locally

Please consider using PostreSQL as database engine. You are free to alter database schema as needed - adding indices, triggers, functions, etc.
